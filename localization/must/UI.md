Consider how product UI looks like.
 * Is there room to render texts in other languages, or texts will be truncated?
 * Is there some ordered lists? shall they look different depending on the language?
 * Is there some overlapping/misaligned control or menu entry?
 * Are there hotkeys to trigger actions? in such case, are they defined for all languages?
