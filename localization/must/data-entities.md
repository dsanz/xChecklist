Consider the set of data entites involved in the feature. Should they have internationalized variants?

What does international variant mean for each entity? Consider 
 * id vs name: name shall be localizable, id not
 * entity attributes/data nature: some items need localization but others may not
 * whether entity has URL or not. If it has, check URL related items
